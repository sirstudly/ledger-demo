# Ledger Posting System Design and Implementation

See [PROBLEM.md](PROBLEM.md) for complete task details.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Integration and Unit Test Cases:** Tests should be clear, behavior-driven, and cover both unit and integration aspects.
- **Communication:** The system should support both synchronous (e.g., REST APIs) and asynchronous (e.g., messaging) communication.
- **Swagger Spec:** Provide API documentation using Swagger.
- **Readme Documentation:** Include any additional instructions or information necessary for reviewers.

## Problem Statement Breakdown
- **Scalable Ledger System:** Must handle heavy write loads efficiently.
- **Modularity and Scalability:** Use microservices, CQRS, and event sourcing.
- **Retrievable Ledger Balances:** Ability to get ledger balances for a specific timestamp.
- **API-friendly:** For asset transfers and account management.
- **Behavior-Driven Testing:** Comprehensive tests that describe system behavior.


## Implementation Summary
The system is split into two smaller microservices:
1. The public RESTful API
  - handles all client requests
  - validates requests for correctness
  - create Kafka events for any "updates"
  - queries datastore for any "reads"
2. The event processor
  - consumes all "update" Kafka events
  - updates datastore
  - create Kafka completion events

Apache Kafka will be used as the event streaming platform to pass information between the two applications.
PostgreSQL is currently used as the datastore.
- future improvement: should we migrate to ksqlDB? https://developer.confluent.io/patterns/event-processing/event-processing-application/

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Decoupling**: The API and event processor applications are decoupled and communicate through Kafka, enhancing modularity and fault tolerance.
- **Scalability**: Both applications can scale independently based on their specific load characteristics.
- **Simplified Architecture**: Reduces the need for synchronous HTTP calls between the services, leveraging Kafka for reliable and efficient communication.
- **Consistency and Reliability**: Kafka ensures reliable delivery of events and can handle retries and failures gracefully.

## Build and Deployment

Run ```docker-compose up --build``` in this directory to build and run the following docker containers:
- ledger-api: The RESTful server implemented as a Spring Boot webapp. It can be accessed on port 6868. API endpoints are published in Swagger (TODO).
- event-processor: Handles all updates to the datastore.
- Apache Kafka: Our event streaming platform. It can be accessed on port 29092.
- Apache ZooKeeper: The distribution and coordination server used by Kafka. It can be accessed on port 2181.
- PostgresSQL: Our datastore. It can be accessed on port 5432.
